## üöó How to View the Project Correctly

To properly view and test the website with all images, links, and styling working as intended, follow these steps:

1. Open the parent directory (Car Dealer Website) in Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the "Go Live" extension or run a local development server from the parent folder.
3. Once the server is active, navigate to the desired HTML pages using your browser.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Opening the HTML files directly in the browser (without a server) may break links, images, or styles. Always use a local server to ensure full functionality.
